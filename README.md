# react-redux-firebase-webapp

This is an exercise project based on The Net Ninja's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi4v5uxTY5o&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iWstfXntcj8f-dFZ4UtlN3 "The Net Ninja tutorial").

**What I learned:**
  - creating reusable [React](https://reactjs.org) components (class-based as well as function-based);
  - using [Materialize](https://materializecss.com "Webpage of Materialize") to build up and style my components;
  - state management using [Redux](https://redux.js.org);
  - async fetch with [Redux-Thunk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-thunk);
  - basics of [Firebase, Firestore](https://firebase.google.com);
  - non-sql database manipulation.
  
**The most proud of** <br/>
