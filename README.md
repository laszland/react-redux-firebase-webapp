# react-redux-firebase-webapp

This is an exercise project based on The Net Ninja's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi4v5uxTY5o&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iWstfXntcj8f-dFZ4UtlN3 "The Net Ninja tutorial").

#What I learned:
  - creating reusable React components (class-based as well as function-based);
  - state management using Redux;
  - async fetch with Redux-Thunk;
  - basics of Firebase, Firestore;
  - non-sql database manipulation.
